# EarthLocals - Volunteering made easy
EarthLocals is a software platform developed as a project for our "Software Engineering" course @ Universit√† Degli Studi Di Salerno (2025).
The goal of the project is to create an enviroment in which both organizers and volunteers can easily communicate and organize new experiences and humanitarian missions.
